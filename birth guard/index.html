                        <q>The shock of my life!! First, I thought it was just a pregnancy scare, as the pains were slight, nonetheless I went to the clinic just to verify. Only to find out that I was three months pregnant. As I was about to faint, thinking about how I was to pay the anti-natal program I had to be put on immediately, the clinic receptionist handed over the birth guard pamphlet and to my relief, just with a scan of a QR code, my profile was uploaded in the system and i received immediate approval after screening and I qualified for prestigious cover which meant I could immediately get a shuttle back home. Birth guard you are my savior!!<q>

                        <q> I'm a mother of three. The pregnancy birth of my third born child was enjoyable. Through the Anti Natal Cover option by Birth Guard, I was able to use the Private Dr for Anti Natal Clinic and the birth of our child: in the presence of my husband, the opportunity that Public hospitals does not offer: I mean to go to the Maternity room with my husband. Long queues and grounded Maternity halls are a thing of the past. Thank you Birth Guard for your prestigious dignified services. Birth Guard, I am grateful, join today!!!</q>
